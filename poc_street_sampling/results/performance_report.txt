  - Estimated sample points:     441,600
  - Estimated storage size:       1809.1 MB (1.77 GB)

NOTE: These are linear projections. Actual performance may vary due to:

======================================================================
5B. FLANDERS-SPECIFIC PROJECTIONS
======================================================================

Flanders context:
  - 308 municipalities
  - Estimated 2,000-5,000 distinct neighborhoods (depends on granularity)
  - Mix of urban centers, suburbs, and rural areas

Conservative (2,000 neighborhoods):
  Single-threaded processing:
    - Time:              7.8 hours (0.3 days)
    - Sample points:     883,200
    - Storage:           3.5 GB
  With 8-core parallelization:
    - Time:              1.0 hours

Moderate (3,000 neighborhoods):
  Single-threaded processing:
    - Time:             11.8 hours (0.5 days)
    - Sample points:   1,324,800
    - Storage:           5.3 GB
  With 8-core parallelization:
    - Time:              1.5 hours

Comprehensive (5,000 neighborhoods):
  Single-threaded processing:
    - Time:             19.6 hours (0.8 days)
    - Sample points:   2,208,000
    - Storage:           8.8 GB
  With 8-core parallelization:
    - Time:              2.4 hours

Key insights for Flanders rollout:
  - Single-threaded: 2,000 neighborhoods = ~7.8 hours
  - With 8 cores:    2,000 neighborhoods = ~1.0 hour
  - Full Flanders (5,000): ~2.4 hours with 8-core parallelization
  - Storage requirements: 3-9 GB for full Flanders dataset

Recommended approach:
  1. Phase 1: Major cities + suburbs (~500 neighborhoods, ~15 min parallel)
  2. Phase 2: Mid-size towns (~1,000 neighborhoods, ~30 min parallel)
  3. Phase 3: Full coverage (~2,000-5,000 neighborhoods, ~1-2 hours)
  4. Ongoing: Weekly incremental updates (~1 hour/week)

======================================================================
6. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
======================================================================

Estimated throughput:
  - Sample points generated:            31.3 samples/second
  - Distance calculations:             883.2 calculations/second
  - Neighborhoods processed:            4.26 neighborhoods/minute

Key bottlenecks:
  1. POI Extraction (~60s, ~43%)
  2. Street Extraction (~30s, ~21%)
  3. Map Generation (~30s, ~21%)

======================================================================
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

For production deployment:
  - Consider batch processing neighborhoods in parallel (multi-core)
  - Implement incremental updates for OSM data (avoid full reprocessing)
  - Use spatial database (PostGIS) for efficient distance queries
  - Pre-compute and cache SmartLabels for common queries
  - Monitor memory usage for large-scale processing
  - Consider map tile generation instead of single large HTML file
