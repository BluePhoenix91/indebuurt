KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. PT Threshold Issue:
   - 400m threshold appears too lenient
   - Even rural/suburban areas get 'Excellent PT access'
   - Recommendation: Reduce to 250-300m for 'Excellent'

2. Green Space Data Quality:
   - OSM data includes facade gardens, not just public parks
   - Leads to mismatches in expected park access
   - Recommendation: Filter to leisure=park only

3. Label Granularity:
   - POC uses simplified 2-tier system (within/limited)
   - Expected profiles assume 3-4 tiers
   - This causes some 'mismatches' that are actually reasonable
